            <h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
            <p> 
                I'm Andrew, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. <br> 
                Prior to college, I had not even dreamed of finding myself doing programming in college. <br> 
                To me, only people who were exceptionally talented at mathematics could undergo such a pursuit. <br>
                Later, in my senior year in high school, I competed in a hackathon for my high school. <br>
                While it was incredibly difficult to me, I developed a newfound appreciation for programming. <br>
                More specifically, looking at how others utilize different techniques to improve performance. <br>
                After this, I was interested in seeing how I could contribute to the medical field using programming. <br>
                Thus, I enrolled in the Computer Science program here to accomplish my goals for the future. <br>
                Currently, I am applying to Computational Biology Graduate Programs around the nation.
