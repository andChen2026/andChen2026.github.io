            <h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
            <p> 
                I'm Andrew, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. <br> 
                Prior to college, I had not even dreamed of finding myself doing programming in college. <br> 
                To me, it was something done by people who had a talent in it; Certainly not someone like me. <br>
                Later, in my senior year in high school, I competed in a hackathon for my high school. <br>
                While it was incredibly difficult to me, I developed a newfound appreciation for programming. <br>
                More specifically, looking at how others utilize different techniques to improve performance. <br>
                After this, I was enthralled to see how I could contribute to the medical field using programming. <br>
                Thus, I enrolled in the Computer Science program here to accomplish my goals for the future. <br>
                Currently, I am applying to Computational Biology Graduate Programs around the nation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of college, I am described as a very energetic and funny person to be around. <br>
                I have historically enjoyed playing RTS - real time simulation - genre games, which is a <br>
                a genre of games in which one commands an entire army and all aspects of it. <br>
                When I'm not in front of a computer or in class, I will typically be seen walking around campus, <br>
                talking to friends, or trying to get bigger at the gym (pray for me!).
